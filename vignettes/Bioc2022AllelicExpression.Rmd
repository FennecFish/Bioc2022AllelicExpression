## Overview

### Description

In this workshop, we will cover a newly developed suite of tools for
performing analysis of allelic expression in Bioconductor. You will
learn about how we use upstream tools like `g2gtools` and `Salmon` to
quantify allelic expression for RNA-seq, and then how to explore the
data in R using the `fishpond` package. Altogether we call this suite
of tools *SEESAW* for
"Statistical Estimation Of allelic Expression Using Salmon And sWish".

### Background and other methods

The SEESAW set of methods for quantifying and analyzing allelic data
is similar to 
[mmseq](https://github.com/eturro/mmseq), 
in which uncertainty of assignment of reads to isoforms and alleles is
estimated, stored, and using in statistical testing.
It is also similar to 
[EMASE](https://emase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which
provides quantification at isoform and allele level;
SEESAW also use the same upstream pipeline as EMASE for construction
of diploid reference transcripts.

Our approach differs from existing methods for detecting allelic
imbalance in RNA-seq data such as 
[WASP](https://github.com/bmvdgeijn/WASP)
or the Bioconductor package
[AllelicImbalance](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/AllelicImbalance),
in that we do not focus on pileup of reads on particular SNPs, but
instead integrate the isoform- and allele-level information contained
in reads aligning to entire transcripts (including both SNP and indel
variation). However, these existing methods can be used across
patients with different genomes, while the SEESAW methods are designed
for analyzing replicate samples with the same diploid genomes (e.g. F1
crosses, or time series of human cell lines).

A recent method for isoform- and allele-level testing is the
Bioconductor package
[PAIRADISE](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/PAIRADISE),
which quantifies reads that contain both allelic and isoform-level
information: those that contain both a heterozygous SNP and a splice
juntion.
Another relevant recently developed method is
[ASEP](https://github.com/Jiaxin-Fan/ASEP),
which allows for gene-level allelic imbalance detection, accounting
for unknown genotype of other nearby regulatory variants.
PAIRADISE and ASEP are therefore applicable across populations of
genotypically diverse individuals. We link to these publications for
background reading below.

## What is allelic expression and why do we care

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Diagram of chromosomes with homozygous and heterozygous alleles, from URL: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Heterozygous.jpg"}

```

Let us assume for this workshop that we are studying a diploid
organism, and we focus on the genes with two copies (so genes on the
autosome, and e.g. chr X for XX individuals). We do not consider here
allelic quantification in cases of complex copy number such as tumor
gene expression. 

In most RNA-seq pipelines, we are concerned with *total expression* of
genes or transcripts, where we do not distinguish between RNA
transcripts from either of the two chromosomes. Suppose the light blue
region highlighted above is a gene, and there are two alleles (B and
b) which differ by one or more genetic variants. In the case that
there are genetic variants falling within the exons of the gene, some
RNA-seq reads may contain information that allows us to determine the
origin of the RNA transcript, whether from the B chromosome or the b
chromosome. Typically, RNA-seq analysis pipelines just are concerned
with counting reads aligning to the light blue region, perhaps
attempting to identify which splice isoforms these align to, but not
concerned with identifying which chromosome the reads come from.

What does allelic tell us...

Why bootstrapping? Why do we need this information?

## SEESAW pipeline

At the beginning of the workshop, we will give an overview of the
steps that need to take place outside of R, before we import the
allelic data into Bioconductor. These are outlined as the first parts
of the pipeline in the diagram below. These are also described in
detail in the 
[allelic vignette](https://mikelove.github.io/fishpond/articles/allelic.html) 
for the fishpond package.

The input to the pipeline of methods is RNA-seq data (FASTQ files),
information about the diploid reference genome (e.g. VCF file), and
information about the isoforms (e.g. GTF file). The SEESAW suite of
methods is currently designed to work for experiments with multiple
replicates of samples with the same diploid genome, e.g. F1 crosses,
or time series of human cell lines.

The R code below will begin at the center blue square with
`importAllelicCounts()`, assuming that diploid quantification with
bootstrap replicates for uncertainty has already been performed.

## Importing allelic counts

The following five un-evaluated code chunks were used to import the
allelic quantification from Salmon into R. These are un-evaluated, as
the original data is too large to include in this package.

First, we define `coldata` and `txps`, which describe the sample
metadata, and the genomic ranges of the transcripts that were
quantified (the haploid reference transcripts). We do not yet have a
convenient way to describe the location of the transcripts in the
diploid genome, so we still rely on a single reference genome here,
although a diploid genome was used for quantifying allelic expression.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# `files` points to `quant.sf` files in original Salmon directories
# other vectors here describe the samples
coldata <- data.frame(cross, day, files, names)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
#query(ah, c("EnsDb","102","Mus musculus"))
edb <- ah[["AH89211"]]
txps <- transcripts(edb)
```

We can group to the gene level with the following `group_id`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(plyranges)
txps <- txps %>%
  select(tx_id, group_id=gene_id)
```

The following code chunk imports the allelic data, creating a "wide"
*SummarizedExperiment* object which will have 2x the number of columns
as the samples listed in `coldata`. We specify the strings that
distinguish the `a1` and `a2` allele in the transcript FASTA file 
(these are suffices that follow the transcript name, separated with an
underscore, e.g. `ENST123_ref` and `ENST123_alt`.
By convention, the `a2` allele describes the reference allele.
In the `gse` object (gene-level SummarizedExperiment), the `a2`
allelic counts will appear as the first columns followed by the `a1`
allelic counts. Here we supply `txps` as a *GRanges* object with a
metadata column `group_id` that describes how we collapse
transcript-level counts.


```{r eval=FALSE}
library(fishpond)
gse <- importAllelicCounts(
  coldata, a1="alt", a2="ref",
  format="wide", tx2gene=txps,
)
```

Finally, we performed minimal filtering on the features:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# filtering out lowly expressed features:
keep <- rowSums(assay(gse) >= 10) >= 6
table(keep)
gse <- gse[keep,]
```

Alternatively, we can group transcript-level counts to the TSS level
using the following code chunk to define `txps`. `makeTx2Tss()` is a
convenience function in *fishpond*. The `maxgap=50` argument means we
will group together transcripts that have TSS that fall within 50bp of
each other.

```{r eval=FALSE}
txps <- makeTx2Tss(edb, maxgap=50) %>%
  select(tx_id, gene_id, group_id, tss)
```

## Explore allelic counts

We have two pre-packaged datasets as part of this workshop
package, one where allelic counts from an RNA-seq experiment are
summarized to the gene level, and another where they are summarized to
the TSS level.

The datasets are described in the man pages (see References), but
briefly, mouse osteoblast cells were differentiated over a time course
from day 2 to day 18. The data has been subset to just the genes on
chr1. A reference for the experiment is:

> Kemp JP, Medina-Gomez C, Estrada K, St Pourcain B et al.
> Phenotypic dissection of bone mineral density reveals skeletal site specificity
> and facilitates the identification of novel loci in the genetic regulation of
> bone mass attainment. PLoS Genet 2014 Jun;10(6):e1004423. PMID: 24945404
> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4063697/>

We load the gene-level dataset:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(Bioc2022AllelicExpression)
data(osteoblast_gene_chr1)
osteoblast_gene_chr1
g <- osteoblast_gene_chr1
```

The sample metadata:

```{r}
colData(g)
```

For each sample and each allele, we have counts and also bootstrap
replicates. The bootstrap replicates are from Salmon, by specifying
`--numBootstraps 30` during quantification. 

**Q: Why do we need bootstrap replicates?**

We can use *fishpond* functions to do some basic exploration of the
allelic counts. 

```{r histBoot}
library(fishpond)
assayNames(g)
dat <- getTrace(g, idx=1, samp_idx="129xB6-d02-a2")
hist(dat$count, border="white", col="grey50", xlab="estimated count, a2")
```

This plot shows the distribution of estimated counts for the first
feature, and for the day 2 sample of the 129xB6 cross, reference allele.
We can also visualize the distributions for all samples using
`plotInfReps()`:

```{r plotInfReps}
plotInfReps(g, idx=1, x="allele", legend=TRUE)
```

We can also group the allelic counts ordered by sample, e.g.:

```{r plotInfReps2}
gcast <- g[,g$cross == "CASTxB6"]
plotInfReps(gcast, idx=1, x="allele", cov="day", legend=TRUE)
```

In the above plot, the samples are ordered by sample, as if `day` x
`allele` were a categorical variable. We can also plot `day` on its
original continuous scale. To do so, we use points and lines to
represent the bootstrap distribution instead of boxplots. To draw the
line, we need to first compute the bootstrap variance, which can be
computed with the `computeInfRV()` function (InfRV = "inferential
relative variance", a useful diagnostic for comparing uncertainty
across features):

```{r plotInfReps3}
gcast <- computeInfRV(gcast)
plotInfReps(gcast, idx=1, x="day", cov="allele",
            shiftX=.2, legend=TRUE)
```
